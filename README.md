#Challenges

These are a collection of interview questions/challenges that I hope may be used to make it easier for people to have interactive sessions instead of doing everything via a whiteboard.


The idea is to set up a rest based framework for each of the Interfaces that must be implemented for each challenge, and then write a few wrapper libraries for other languages that the interviewee can implement in.
